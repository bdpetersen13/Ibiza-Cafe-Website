# Ibiza Cafe

Ibiza Cafe is a small is a unique coffee and tes shop in Frederick, MD with a variety of single origin coffee supplemented with tasteful hot teas. Coffees are brewed either as siphon or pour overs. For your hunger they provide sandwiches, pastries and fresh waffles. AND don't forget our delicious bubble teas.



## Motivation

I am a big fan of Ibiza Cafe and often order tea and food online. As a CS student, I have been learning full-stack development. While the class has been exciting and helpful, I have found the overall web development knowledge to be a bit lackluster. 

I decided to redesign the Ibiza Cafe website, http://www.theibizacafe.com/, utilizing only HTML, CSS, and the bootstrap framework.

The website I designed is a Single Page Application, SPA, that informs users about Ibiza Caf√©, who they are, what items they sell, and their hours and location. 

## Goal

The main goal of this project was to design a fully functional protoype web application utilizing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
